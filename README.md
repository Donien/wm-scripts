# Scripts for Window Managers

## Why?

Many desktop environments offer an easy way of using shortcuts to do various things.  
They let you change your audio devices, lock your screen, mute your audio input or output, increase or decrease volume, adjust your display brightness, take screenshots and much, much more.  

**Window managers** on the other handy tend to give you the bare minimum. A few pre-defined shortcuts to...well...**manage windows**.  
More often than not you will find yourself in the situation that you need to create custom shortcuts and potentially scripts to go along with these shortcuts in order make your desktop usable.  

**The aim of this repository** is to show people ways in which to achieve what full blown desktop environments offer by default.  
I personally love to build a lot of stuff myself including scripts to do basic things.  
I may not be the best when it comes to scripting but **solutions that work are solutions**.  

If this repository helps or guides at least one person it is worth sharing.  
Elsewise I've got a reference for myself which is nice, too!  


## Structure

At this point in time the *"plan"* is to just dump my personal scripts in here.  
Some *"scripts"* will be one-liners as opposed to actual scripts. Yet they will be in their own dedicated file in order to have at least some structure.  

In the future - depending on how this evolves - I might consider thinking about a proper way to structure this project.
